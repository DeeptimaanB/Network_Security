**All the programs are written in Python**

The programs in this repository were successfully compiled in Kali linux and will work on most of the Linux distros.

Only some of the programs might run on windows. They are:

1. network_scanner.py

//Use the echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward command to enable port forwarding when you are arp_spoofing
